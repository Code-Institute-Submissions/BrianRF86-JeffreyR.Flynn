Project Name: 
User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

Motivation:
Jeffrey is my brother who is looking to have a digital footprint to grow his business as an artist. I wanted to create a website template that could be used with other artists looking to have an online presence. The current project could be used as a basic template for new customers.

Copyright status:
All images are owned by the Artist (Jeffrey Ruiz Harries) who has provided me with the authority to use the images on the website. 

Dependencies:

Bootstrap : Elements of bootstrap 3.0 was used for the header and footer. 
Course notes/code examples: Template from course notes was used as a foundation. Some of the code was chainged through out the process but was a key element in building the page. 

W 3 schools and Stack overflow pages were used exentisively for code snippets (highlighted comments in code.) Other pages were used as further research, especially on the grid image carousel
